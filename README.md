# JSON Signature Scheme (JSS)

Please see the X-jss.md file for the full proposed specification. Please note
that the section number are the way they are to faciliate the ITU-T SG17
template. 

## Abstract

This document carries the proposed 1st revision of the baseline text for X.jss:
JSON Signature Scheme (JSS).

X.jss defines a method called JSS (JSON Signature Scheme) which enables JSON
objects to be signed and/or countersigned while leaving the original JSON
objects themselves in JSON format. This process enables a consistent data
format that simplifies the use, documentation, debugging, and logging of the
JSON data while still allowing it to be digitally signed. Further, with this
method, signed JSON objects can be used and processed just like standard JSON
objects which simplifies their use for application developers and systems.
